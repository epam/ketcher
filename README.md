Ketcher is an open-source web-based chemical structure editor incorporating high performance, good portability, light weight, and ability to easily integrate into a custom web-application. Ketcher is designed for chemists, laboratory scientists and technicians who draw structures and reactions.

## Key Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast 2D structure representation that satisfies common chemical drawing standards
- :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: 3D structure visualization
- :memo: Template library (including custom and user's templates)
- üî© Add atom and bond basic properties and query features, add aliases and Generic groups
- :cyclone: Stereochemistry support during editing, loading, and saving chemical structures
- :loop: Storing history of actions, with the ability to rollback to previous state
- :floppy_disk: Ability to load and save structures and reactions in MDL Molfile or RXN file format, InChI String, ChemAxon Extended SMILES, ChemAxon Extended CML file formats
- :microscope: Zoom in/out, hotkeys, cut/copy/paste
- :crystal_ball: OCR - ability to recognize structures at pictures (image files) and reproduce them
- :clipboard: Copy and paste between different chemical editors
- üõ†Ô∏è Settings support (Rendering, Displaying, Debugging)
- :camera: Use of SVG to achieve best quality in-browser chemical structure rendering

### Editor builtin tools:

- Atom Tool, Bond Tool, and Template Tool to draw and edit structures
- Aromatize/De-aromatize Tool
- Calculate CIP Descriptors Tool
- Structure Check Tool
- MW and Structure Parameters Calculate Tool
- Select, modify, and erase connected and unconnected atoms and bonds using Selection Tool, or using Shift key
- Advanced Structure Clean up Tool (+ stereochemistry checking and structure layout)
- Simple Structure Clean up Tool (checks bonds length, angles and spatial arrangement of atoms)
- Easy to use R-Group and S-Group tools (Generic, Multiple group, SRU polymer, peratom, Data S-Group)
- Reaction Tool (reaction generating, manual and automatic atom-to-atom mapping)
- Flip/Rotate Tool

## Installation and usage

At this moment Ketcher can be embedded into your application in two ways:

- as a [react component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ketcher-react)
- as ready-to-run application (to find desired version please look at Assets block of [releases](https://github.com/epam/ketcher/releases)). The application can be injected as IFrame or a separate page.
