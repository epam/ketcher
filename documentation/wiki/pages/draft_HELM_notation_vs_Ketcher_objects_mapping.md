HELM GLOSSARY: 
1.	HELM – (Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules) is a hierarchical representation of components at four levels: Complex Polymer, Simple Polymer, Monomer, and Atom.
2.	Atom/bonds – used to define monomers.
3.	Monomers – used as the building blocks of simple polymers.
4.	Simple polymers – chains of monomers connected in a predefined and consistent way. There are 3 type of monomers: Peptide, RNA and Chem.
5.	Complex polymers – chains of simple polymers connected as defined by the user constructing the molecule.
6.	Monomer type specifies its place in the polymer skeleton. There are two types: backbone and branch.
7.	backbone –a monomer type, the main repetitive elements of a sequence. A backbone monomer is included in the main linear polymer chain (for example, in RNA polymers, sugar and phosphate linkers are of ‘backbone’ monomer type).
8.	branch – a monomer type that does not form part of the main polymeric chain (for example, in RNA polymers the nucleobase is a ‘branch’ monomer type).
