| Ketcher **polymer** editor user | to open *.mol file containing peptide structure  | I can see the structure in Ketcher and be able to modify it using Ketcher |
| Ketcher **polymer** editor user | to open *.helm file containing peptide structure | I can see the structure in Ketcher and be able to modify it using Ketcher |

#### 1. Context

Supported formats are: *.mol (v3000), *.HELM and text files with MOL or HELM notation inside (*.txt , .*doc, .docx, .rtf). 
Explore the *.mol information here: 

Peptide structures are supported only by the v3000 format of the *.mol file. **The v2000 format is not presents structured view of polymers and couldn't be recognized by peptide editor. The problem for future development is to recognize polymer structure in v2000 format from the chemical libraries**. 

There are 2 possible ways to capture the peptides in the v3000 mol file, explore them here **http://help.accelrysonline.com/insight/2018/content/pdf_files/bioviachemicalrepresentation.pdf**:



Glossary: [Peptide Glossary](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMLSOP/Peptide+Glossary) - check it for information on HELM format

#### 3. Assumptions

| **ID** | **Assumption**                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | HELM notation will most like be opened as text pasted from the clipboard. Opening from files of .helm, .txt format would be more ra**r**e scenario. |
| 2      | *.MOL notation of v3000 will be opened mostly from files with *.mol, *.txt format. Opening from clipboard will be more rare scenario, but we should support it just like we do in general Ketcher. |
| 3      |                                                              |

####  4. Additional information (optional)

The window will have the same appearance as in the standard Ketcher,  except the image opening icon
