HELM GLOSSARY: 
1.	HELM – (Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules) is a hierarchical representation of components at four levels: Complex Polymer, Simple Polymer, Monomer, and Atom.
2.	Atom/bonds – used to define monomers.
3.	Monomers – used as the building blocks of simple polymers.
4.	Simple polymers – chains of monomers connected in a predefined and consistent way. There are 3 type of monomers: Peptide, RNA and Chem.
5.	Complex polymers – chains of simple polymers connected as defined by the user constructing the molecule.
6.	Monomer type specifies its place in the polymer skeleton. There are two types: backbone and branch.
7.	backbone –a monomer type, the main repetitive elements of a sequence. A backbone monomer is included in the main linear polymer chain (for example, in RNA polymers, sugar and phosphate linkers are of ‘backbone’ monomer type).
8.	branch – a monomer type that does not form part of the main polymeric chain (for example, in RNA polymers the nucleobase is a ‘branch’ monomer type).

The first is the source polymer ID, which identifies the source polymer. The second is the target polymer ID, which identifies the target polymer. The third is the detailed connection description, which identifies the source monomer position and attachment point as well as target monomer position and attachment point. The dash symbol “-” is used to separate source monomer from target monomer, and the colon symbol “:” to separate monomer position from attachment point. Source and target can be switched in the connection notation. Hydrogen bond list representation is similar to connection list representation discussed above, except that no attachment points are used. Instead, a four letter code “Pair” is used to replace the attachment point in the connection string. <br />Example 1: <br />![HELM_HBOND_Example1](https://github.com/epam/ketcher/blob/master/documentation/wiki/HELM_HBOND_Example1.png)<br />Example 2:<br />![HELM_HBOND_Example2](https://github.com/epam/ketcher/blob/master/documentation/wiki/HELM_HBOND_Example2.png) |                                                              |
