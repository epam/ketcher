The PubChem Blog is intended to help you better understand PubChem, explore issues of scientific interest that drive the development of new features, and demonstrate how you can use our resources to help enhance your research.

 We have categorized our blog posts into four types:
 PubChem Explained â provides perspective on our resources and procedures to help you better understand us and avoid misconceptions and misunderstandings.
Whatâs New â introduces new and updated PubChem resources and include specific examples that demonstrate how you can use these to enhance your research.
Quick Tips & Tricks â explains how to perform specific tasks using our website. Selected topics will be chosen based on questions you have asked and suggestions you have provided.
Science Features â explores current topics in science and demonstrates how you can find relevant data or resources on our website for further exploration.
These categorized posts are easily accessible by clicking on the Category buttons under the header graphic at the top of the page.  All posts are archived by month and tagged with keywords relevant to the content. You can navigate these through the links in the right sidebar.

This blog is a complement to our existing education and outreach efforts, such as News and Social Media outlets, and Help Desk user support.

If have any topics or suggestions for blog posts, please let us know.

Be sure to check back with us every week or so, and let us know what you think!

As this is a public forum, we do have some policies that need mentioning. Please note that we reserve the right to modify these policies at any time.

Comment Policy:
We encourage respectful and constructive dialogue about the information presented in PubChem Blog posts. Please share your thoughts with us and other readers. However, it is important to note that the views expressed within these posted comments do not necessarily reflect those of the United States Federal Government.

This is a moderated blog, and all comments will be reviewed before they are posted to ensure compliance with our comment policy.  Here are some guidelines for comments:

Stay focused â All viewpoints are welcome, but comments should remain relevant to the post you to which are responding. Only comments that relate to the topic under discussion will be posted.
While weâd love to be able to help out as much as we can, specific questions about or issues with the PubChem web site or data represented within should be sent to the NCBI help desk.

Be respectful â Comments will not be posted if they contain personal attacks, which include discriminatory, racist, offensive, obscene, inflammatory, unlawful or otherwise objectionable statements, language or content.
Tell the truth â Spreading misleading or false information is prohibited.
Be careful about including links â Since all posts and comments are visible to anyone that stumbles upon this blog, please donât link to any data or information that would cause security problems or breach confidentiality agreements
Please note that we retain the discretion to determine which comments violate our comment policy and reserve the right to not publically post comments that violate our comment policy.

We recognize that the Web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. However, given the need to manage federal resources, i.e., your tax dollars, moderating and posting comments should only be expected to occur during regular business hours. Comments submitted after hours or on weekends will be read and posted as early as possible; in most cases, this means the next business day.
