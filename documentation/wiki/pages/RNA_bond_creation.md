#### 1. Context

Glossary: [Peptide Glossary](https://github.com/epam/ketcher/wiki/Polymer-Glossary) 

RNA chain has backbone part that consists a sequence of the Sugars and Phosphates alternating. Sugar has enough connection points to connect with additional monomer that is called branch one. For RNA chain it will be Nucleobase. Each RNA monomer separately is considered a RNA chain, but their non-valid structures are not. Those non-valid situations will be handled differently: some type of connections can not even be established on the canvas, while the other ones can be drawn, but the structures will not be represented in HELM notation and alignment rules will not be applied for them.  

#### 3. Assumptions

| **ID** | **Assumption**                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | Ketcher Polymer Editor users are mostly focused on creating the RNA chains that valid and have the connections reflecting the real RNA structure |
| 2      | RNA chains can be quite long and contain dozens of backbone monomers |
|        |                                                              |
